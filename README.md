**Taxi Fare Prediction** - Regression
This is a prediction machine learning model. In this project, my objective was to predict the fare of a taxi based on latitude pickup and dropoff and longitude pickup and drop off. I applied data cleaning, calculating the distance between the source and the destination. I have implemented some ML regression algorithms and tested the score of the model

**Steps:**
Import Libraries and read data set
Describe the dataset
Handling Missing Values
Data Transforamtion / Categorical to Numerical
Data Cleaning and Feature Selection
Spliting the dataset 
Machine Learning Modeling
train the model (Fit)
Test the trained model (prediction )
Model Evaluation
